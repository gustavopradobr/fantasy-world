# About the game
Fantasy World is a prototype game that uses the Top Down 2D style. You can walk, attack, gather coins, spend them in new items/clothes, talk to NPCs and fight some enemies.

This prototype was developed within 76 hours to attend a task that required a top-down 2D game with the following features:

*   A playable character that can walk and interact with the world.
*   A functional clothes shop: talking to the shopkeeper, buying and selling items.
